# CSE423-3D-Traffic-Simulation-System
A 3D traffic simulation system where vehicles move through controlled road intersections in different environments such as city roads and highways. The system includes traffic signals, vehicle movement, collision avoidance, and multiple camera views. The simulation helps visualize real-world traffic behavior using computer graphics concepts and OpenGL-based rendering.

How to Run the Project (Steps)

First, download the project files.

Then, copy and paste the provided .py file into the project folder.

Open the folder in Visual Studio Code (VS Code).

Make sure Python and required libraries are installed on your system.

Run the .py file from VS Code.

The program will run successfully because it is an OpenGL-based 3D simulation code.
