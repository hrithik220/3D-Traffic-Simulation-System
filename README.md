# 3D-Traffic-Simulation-System
A 3D traffic simulation system where vehicles move through controlled road intersections in different environments such as city and highway. The system includes traffic signals, vehicle movement, collision avoidance, and multiple camera views. The simulation helps visualize real-world traffic behavior using computer graphics concepts.
